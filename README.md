# Versatile-Voice-Assistant

Our main idea is to propose a new cross platform virtual assistant. Now with a myriad of systems competing for attention and new players in the game with every passing day, we will have to manage the fragmentation and complexity of developing apps across multiple platforms and channels.
We plan to develop one with which we can give a voice input for a laptop as well as a phone and it can perform at the same time if required. It can do all sort of tasks and it will be designed as such it will recognize from the voice input whether the task is for the laptop or the mobile. It can do the tasks given to it provided the task falls in their domain such as playing a YouTube video or a Google search but when it comes to making a phone call or sending a WhatsApp message, what should the assistant do? Here comes the uniqueness of
our assistant, it understands that the laptop cannot perform such a task so the laptop conveys the message to the phone to make the phone call or text the person all by itself. And then there are tasks only for the laptop which the phone cannot execute such as opening the MSPaint so thatâ€™s the decision needs to be taken by our virtual assistant. This is the type of virtual assistant we propose and implement.
